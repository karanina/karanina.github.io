        <h3>Paradise (What About Us) by Within Temptation featuring Tarja</h3>
        <p>
            There's no sense, the fire burns<br>
            When wisdom fails, it changes all<br>
            The wheel embodies all that keeps on turning<br>
            Blood red skies, I feel so cold<br>
            No innocence, we play our roll<br>
            The wheel embodies all, where are we going?
        </p>
        <p>
            All in all, you'd expect the wise to be wiser, fallen from grace and<br>
            All and all I guess we should've known better 'cause</p>
        <p>
            What about us? Isn't it enough?<br>
            No, we're not in paradise<br>
            This is who we are, this is what we've got<br>
            No, it's not our paradise<br>
            But it's all we want, and it's all that we're fighting for<br>
            Though it's not paradise
        </p>
        <p>
            You and us, or I and them<br>
            There comes a time to take a stand<br>
            The wheel is watching all, it keeps on burning<br>
            The venom works, it's like a curse<br>
            A Trojan horse, when will we learn?<br>
            The wheel embodies all that keeps returning
        </p>
        <p>
            All in all, you'd expect the wise to be wiser, fallen from grace and<br>
            All and all I guess we should've known better 'cause</p>
        <p>
            What about us? Isn't it enough?<br>
            No, we're not in paradise<br>
            This is who we are, this is what we've got<br>
            No, it's not our paradise<br>
            But it's all we want, and it's all that we're fighting for<br>

            No, we're not in paradise<br>

            No, it's not our paradise<br>
