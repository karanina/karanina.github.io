    <p>I have spent the majority of my career in offices, in one form or another.</p>
    
    <p>I started my working life as the Database Assistant for a conference company, a job which mostly consisted of data entry and sending out mail merge documents. </p>
    
    <p>My next job was as an Office Assistant (later a Senior Office Assistant) for a jewellery manufacturer. I spent 16 years at the company, and developed a deep love for the industry as a whole. My responsibilities ranged from data entry to proof reading to quoting product. I was cross trained in most areas of the office, and was able to back up the Credit Controller and the Assistant Manager on regular occassions. </p>
    
    <p>However as the years went on I wanted more, and my mind kept coming back to a dream from my childhood: programming!</p>

    <p>This is what led me to study at UNITEC.</p>
